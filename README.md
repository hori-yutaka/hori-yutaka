### <h2>ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, curious coder!</h2>

<p>
  I'm an <strong>Information Technology Analyst</strong> by training, a <strong>Project Manager</strong> by profession, and a low-key 
  <strong>code enthusiast</strong> after hours â€” especially when the coffee kicks in â˜•ðŸ¦‰.
</p>

<p>
  By day, I coordinate teams, tame deadlines, and sit through just the right amount of meetings. 
  By night, I dive into side projects, explore new tech, and occasionally win the eternal battle 
  against semicolons and indentation.
</p>

<p>
  This repository is one of those side quests â€” a space where I experiment, learn, build, and sometimes 
  pretend I didnâ€™t just spend three hours debugging a missing bracket.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Built with curiosity, caffeine, and a healthy respect for the undo button.</em>  
</p>

<p>
  Feel free to explore, fork, or star the project. Contributions are always welcome â€” as long as they come with good vibes and clear commit messages.
</p>
